# SCT_ML_3 - SVM Image Classification (Fashion MNIST)

**Task:** Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of Fashion MNIST dataset.

---

## **Description**

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for image classification using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. The goal is to classify images of fashion items into 10 categories (T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot).

Key highlights:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Training SVM with linear kernel
- Evaluation of model using accuracy and classification report
- Visualization of predictions

## **Technologies & Libraries Used**

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn (`SVC`, `StandardScaler`, `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`)  
- TensorFlow/Keras (for Fashion MNIST dataset)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
